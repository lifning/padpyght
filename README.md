padpyght
========

An open source clone of PadLight with extensions for analog sticks and triggers.
The skin.ini format shouldn't be considered stable quite yet, there are still some
inconsistencies to iron out (for example, 0- vs. 1- indexing the buttons and axes).

Usage
-----
Command line:
  python2 padpyght.py [skin folder] [joystick number]

If you have [PGU](http://code.google.com/p/pgu/) installed, simply run padpyght.py with no arguments to start a GUI,
which will let you choose a joystick and skin to use from lists.
